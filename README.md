A coding bootcamp graduate with a passion for software development. Recently completed the [Makers Academy](https://www.makers.tech/) and now excited to take the next step and get my first junior developer job. I have worked in tech related roles throughout my career and have always wanted to be on the other side of the software.
I would love to work for a company which encourages further growth and development and gives me the chance to continue learning and grow.

## Work Experience

**Booking.com** (Mar '17 to Nov '20)  
_Advanced Role Specialist_

This included liaising with the property manager, setting and agreeing to a budget with the property and setting an action plan on all reservations to reflect this.
- Provided on-going management support to the customer service employees in terms of coaching, guidance and mentoring, for all representatives based in all EMEA offices (over 1500 employees). This included, taking escalated calls from and approving payout for customers and properties alike.

- Managed executive complaints, high-risk reservations and social media complaints.
- Worked alongside team leaders to provide training and workshops, aiming at ensuring consistency and quality of the service provided by Guest Specialists;.
- As part of the role, identified possible fraudulent reservations and/or properties and reported them to be manually checked accordingly.


**Wavetel Ltd.** (Oct '14 to Jun '17)  
_Support Manager_

A multi Faceted role in which my tasks included supervising the support of all customers, make sure any technical or non technical customer query is handled and escalated if required. Helped create policies for signing up new customers for the sales team which included contract compliance etc. Set up new customers in Portaone switch, programmed IP phones and attended sales calls for select clients. Regularly trained new staff on support practices and personally resolved many escalated cases.

## Skills

- Communication
Communication was a key aspect to all of my previous roles. I have worked in both B2C and B2B enviroments. I have always maintained an open line of communication with all of the clients that I personally managed. With booking.com, I was the point of contact for many big hotel chains and worked closely with the GM's to resolve the issues they were having, weather that meant relocating guests arriving or just notifying them with a mass email about a small change. Through the process I always kept in touch with the GM and made sure that at all they were kept in the loop. Which is why in all my previous jobs, clients have always requested to speak to me rather than someone else

- Teamwork
I strongly believe in the mantra "team work makes the dream work"! I have been part of big teams and small tight knit teams also and have been comfortable in both roles. Weather its a team I am managing or a team I am a part of, I make sure that we all work together and achieve our combined goal. I have always known when to take lead or take a back seat. I have requested and been given very positive feedback from my peers. 

- Fast Learner
I have always beleived my self to be a relatively fast learner. My intrest always leads me to learn more and weather in my role at booking.com or Wavetel, I always took pride in teh fact that I was very well versed with procedurs and compliance related things. Furthermore, going through makers and learning new languages and tech stacks has also solidified my belief. In our final project, I was able to learn and delploy a single page web application using the MERN stack, with no prior experience.
