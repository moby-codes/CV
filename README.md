## Syed Mubashar Ali

I am an ambitious Full Stack Junior Developer, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also gaining exposure to the tech industry from a developers point of view.

After working different management jobs, I felt unfulfilled in my career still and decided to take the plunge and do something that I have always wanted to, software development. Having worked in different tech companies in non software related roles in the past paired with my educational background in computer science, I always felt like I was more intrested in how the product was made. My career so far given me the non technical skills to be a valuable team member and succeed in any role. 
I recently completed the [Makers Academy](https://www.makers.tech/) bootcamp and giving me insight and knowledge on how software design and development works and I'm excited to take the next step and get my first junior developer job. 

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Active record, MongoDB, Jest, Jasmine, RSPEC, Capybara

**Wavetel Ltd.** (Oct '14 to Jun '17)  
_Support Manager_

A multi Faceted role in which my tasks included supervising the support of all customers, make sure any technical or non technical customer query is handled and escalated if required.

Regularly trained new staff on support practices and personally resolved many escalated cases.

## Skills

- Communication
Communication was a key aspect to all of my previous roles. I have worked in both B2C and B2B enviroments. I have always maintained an open line of communication with all of the clients that I personally managed. With booking.com, I was the point of contact for many big hotel chains and worked closely with the GM's to resolve the issues they were having, weather that meant relocating guests arriving or just notifying them with a mass email about a small change. Throughout the process I always kept in touch with the GM and made sure that at all times they were kept in the loop. Which is why in all my previous jobs, clients have always requested to speak to me rather than someone else.

- Teamwork
I strongly believe in the mantra "team work makes the dream work"! I have been part of both big and small tight knit teams and have been comfortable in both roles. Weather its a team I am managing or a team I am a part of, I make sure that we all work together towards achieving our combined goal. I have always known when to take lead or to take a back seat and have always received high praise from colleagues and seniors. 

- Fast Learner
I have always beleived myself to be a relatively fast learner. Weather in my role at booking.com or Wavetel, I always took pride in the fact that I was very well versed with procedures and compliance related things. Furthermore, going through makers and learning new languages and tech stacks has also given me the confidence that I can pick up things fairly quick. In our final project, I was able to learn and delploy a single page web application using the MERN stack, with no prior experience.
